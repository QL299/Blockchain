Installing and Running
----------------------

You MUST have Python3.6 installed.

Install solc: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages
(```solc --version``` should give you a good output).

Install ethereum with pip:
```
  sudo python3.6 -m pip install ethereum eth_tester eth-tester[py-evm] web3 web3[tester]
```

Then, run tests with run_tests.py


All tests should pass after completing the withdraw function.
